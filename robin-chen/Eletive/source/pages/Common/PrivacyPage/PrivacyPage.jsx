      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>International Compliance</h2>
    <p>

      protection.
    </p>

    <h2>Security of Information</h2>
    <p>
      We will store and process the personal data in a manner consistent with industry security standards, and as long
      as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy, unless a longer retention is required by law. We have
      implemented technical, organizational and administrative systems, policies, and procedures to help ensure the

    </p>

    <h2>Consent</h2>
    <p>
      Where consent is required for our use of your personal data, by ticking the appropriate consent box or otherwise
      communicating your consent to us (whether by phone, email or other means), you consent to our use of that personal
      data as set out in this policy. If you disclose someone else&#39;s personal data to us, you confirm that you have
      their consent to disclose this to us and for us to use and disclose it in accordance with this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Data storage and retention</h2>
    <p>
      We will not store your personal data for longer than is reasonably necessary to use it in accordance with this
      policy or with our legal rights and obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, aggregated and anonymized data and
      any information other than personal data can be stored indefinitely.
    </p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>
      You have the following rights in regards to your personal information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Access</b>. You have the right to access information about the personal data we hold about you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Object to our processing</b>. You have the right to object to processing of your personal data where that
        processing is being undertaken by us on the basis of our (or a third party’s) legitimate interest. In such a
        case we are required to cease processing your data unless we can demonstrate compelling grounds which override
        your objection. You also have the right to object at any time to the processing by us of your personal data for
        direct marketing purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Correct inaccurate information</b>. You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate personal
        data that we hold about you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Removal</b>. You have the right to request that we erase any personal data that we hold about you, based on
        one of a number of grounds, including the withdrawal of your consent (where our processing of that data is
        undertaken on the basis of your consent), or if your object to our continued processing (as mentioned above).
        This right does not extend to information which is not personal data. Please also note that it is likely to be
        necessary for us to retain your personal data for the purposes of assessing and verifying data that is submitted
        and/or held on the Platform, and your rights under applicable law to request erasure may be limited accordingly.
        We also reserve the right to retain your personal data in an anonymized form for statistical and benchmarking
        purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Restriction of processing</b>. This enables you to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data in
        certain circumstances, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Portability</b>. You have the right to obtain copies of your personal data to enable you to reuse your
        personal data across different services and with different companies.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we
      may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is manifestly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may
      refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to
      access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure
      to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that if you exercise any of the above rights to require us to restrict or cease processing or to
      delete personal data, and this type of processing is required in order to facilitate your use of the Platform, you
      will no longer be able to use the Platform following the date on which we action your request. This does not
      include your right to object to direct marketing which can be exercised at any time without restriction. Please
      allow at least 5 working days for your request to be actioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      If for any reason you are not happy with the way that we have handled your personal data, you also have the right
      to make a complaint to the relevant supervisory authority in your country. In Sweden, these complaints can be sent
      to the Swedish Data Protection Authority (Datainspektionen in Swedish).
